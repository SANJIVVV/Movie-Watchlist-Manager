# Movie Watchlist Manager

A simple C++ console application that helps users manage their movie watchlist. This program allows users to add, remove, search, display, and sort movies in their watchlist. It also tracks recently played and last played movies, making it a handy tool for movie enthusiasts.

## Features
- **Add Movie**: Add a movie to the watchlist by providing the movie title, genre, and rating (0.0 - 10.0).
- **Delete Movie**: Remove a movie from the watchlist by its title.
- **Display Watchlist**: View the full list of movies in the watchlist with their title, genre, and rating.
- **Search Movie**: Search for a specific movie in the watchlist by its title.
- **Play Movie**: Mark a movie as played and track it as the "recently played" movie.
- **Sort Watchlist**: Sort movies in the watchlist alphabetically by their title.
- **Sort Recently Played**: Display the most recently played movie.
- **Display Loaded Movies**: Show a list of all movies that have been loaded from the saved file.
- **Clear Watchlist**: Clear all movies from the watchlist.
- **Total Movies**: Display the total number of movies in the watchlist.
- **Recently Played Movie**: Show the last movie that was played.
- **Last Played Movie**: Show the movie played just before the most recent one.

## Data Storage
Movies are saved in a text file (`watchlist.txt`), where each movieâ€™s details (title, genre, and rating) are saved on a new line. This allows the watchlist to persist across multiple program runs.
